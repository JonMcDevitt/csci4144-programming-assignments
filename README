#CSCI 4144 - Programming Assignments

###Assignment 3

    Understanding of Specifications:
    
        Given an input file consisting of whitespace delimited lines,
        where the first line is a antecedent of table headers and all
        following lines are table rows, construct a antecedent of association
        itemSets for the data. For example, consider the antecedent of data in
        ./src/Assignment3/SampleInput.txt. This table has identified
        twenty-one itemSets with which to work. Each itemSet is comprised of
        a antecedent of predicates and a antecedent of results, both of which are
        composed of multiple headings.
        
        Given an input such as SampleInput.txt, we must produce a
        file which summarizes all of the itemSets.
    
    How to Run
        
        To run the program, execute from any IDE. It takes the
        following inputs:
        
            Minimum support rate for ruleset
            Minimum confidence rate for ruleset
            Relative or absolute path and name of data file
            
        The program will produce the following:
            
            New data file within the Assignment3 directory.
    
    What We Need
    
        Demo class
            -   Minimum support (to decide which itemSets are valid)
            -   Minimum confidence (to decide which itemSets are valid)
        
        Rule object
            -   antecedent  :   Set
            -   result      :   Set
            -   Support     :   Double
            -   Confidence  :   Double
            
            +   constructor :   N/A
            +   get         :   Set, Double
            +   antecedent         :   void
